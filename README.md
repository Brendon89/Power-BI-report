Profit for store report 
This report tells us the profit that was made by the different regions, segments as well as the different categories which are shown with the use of donut charts.

We see the profit made based on order dates with the use of a line graph.
We have a stacked bar chart which shows profit based on sub-categories.
We have a matrix with our different sub-categories as well as the different regions with totals.
We have a slicer where we can click a specific state and the data on each visual will be filtered.
Then lastly we have a scroller which shows the different sub-categories and sales.
